#+Title: Modal / Custom keybindings

* Design principle

- My idea is to design mnemonic keybindings using ~Ryo~ package.
- In modal mode, *<characters>* are used for *frequent* tasks
  like, (1) jumping around buffer, (2) selecting buffer and (3)
  changind buffer.
- *<space> <character>* will be reserved for *typical* tasks.
- *<space> <space> <character>* will be for *rare* tasks.

* Moving around buffer

| Function           | Shortcut | Comments |
|--------------------+----------+----------|
| Forward character  | f        |          |
| Backward character | b        |          |
| Next line          | n        |          |
| Previous line      | p        |          |
| Start of line      | s        |          |
| End of line        | e        |          |
| Go to beginning    | g-b      |          |
| Go to end          | g-e      |          |
| Go to line number  | g-n      |          |
|                    |          |          |
